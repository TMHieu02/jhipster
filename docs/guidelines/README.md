# Engineering Guidelines

This folder contains living documents that describe how we build, test, deploy, and maintain the platform.  
Each topic is split into its own guideline so that new team members can focus on one area at a time.

| Guideline | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| `coding-standards.md` | Language conventions, naming rules, formatting |
| `backend-architecture.md` | Spring Boot layering, persistence, transactions |
| `frontend-architecture.md` | React + Redux structure, styling, accessibility |
| `api-design.md` | REST patterns, versioning, error payloads |
| `testing-quality.md` | Test pyramid, tooling, coverage expectations |
| `security-compliance.md` | Authentication, validation, data protection |
| `delivery-workflow.md` | Git flow, code reviews, CI/CD, release notes |
| `operations-observability.md` | Logging, metrics, alerts, incident response |

> Keep the documents concise but actionable. When processes change, update the relevant guideline and note the revision at the bottom of the file.
